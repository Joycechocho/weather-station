# Project Description
With the goal in mind to get ourselves familiarized with websocket communication, building interface using HTML and continue to develop the QT interface on top of that in Project 1, we have developed a demo that consists of two python programs, a server and a client. The server periodically interacts with the DHT22 sensors and handles temperature/humidity data acquisition as well as storage. It has a QT interface that display temperature/humidity data. The client is a webpage that allow users to access the temperature/humidity data remotely. It requests the data from the server via a websocket developed using [Tornado][t1]. Below is the system diagram:

# Project Features
##### 1. A Server-Client Websocket Implementation

The python program that directly interacts with the sensor serves as a server running on raspberry pi, constantly reading temperature/humidity values periodically (every 10 seconds) and storing the data. On the other hand, another computer that acts as a client, used to send the request to the server to retrieve temperature/humidity data for display.

##### 2. A Client Login Interface with Cookie Authentication.

Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information or to record the user's browsing activity. Authentication cookies are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Here, we implemented cookie authentication to check if user's credential is valid or not. If the user visit /index page without login or cookie stored before, he/she will be redirected to /login page to sign in with the username and password. On the contray, if the user have the cookie stored on the browser before, he/she will visit the main page without needing to login again.

##### 3. A Continuous Graph of Temperature data

An open souce HTML5 chart project is implemented to display the graph of the temperature data since the websocket connection to the server is opened.

##### 4. Robust Error Handling

A run-time error takes place during the execution of a program and usually happens because of adverse system parameters or invalid input data. We have implemented the Exception Handling(Try Catch) in our client webpage. The try block contains set of statements where an exception can occur, while a catch block is where you handle the exceptions. For example, if a user at the client side wants to request the temperature data before connecting to the server, this invalid input would throw a reference error which can be catched by the Exception Handling then it will pop out a warning window reminding the websocket is not connected.

##### 5. Intuitive User Interface

Bootstrap is used in our porject because it includes a powerful mobile-first flexbox grid system for building layouts of all shapes and sizes. It is a front-end web framework that was originally created by developers at Twitter to provide consistency across their internal tools. Today, itâ€™s available to everyone through GitHub as a free and open-source collection of tools containing HTML- and CSS-based design templates and JavaScript (JS) extensions.

# Files Organization
* [python_program_client/] - client side python program
* [python_program_server/] - server side python program
* [database_login/] - the postgreSQL database for user credentail authentication


# Setup
Hardware:
* The setup tutorial of the Raspberry Pi can be found [here][s2]
* The wiring of the DHT22 sensor to Raspberry Pi can be found [here][s1]

The server-side software requires the installation of the packages listed below:

| Packages | Source |

# User Guide
### Server Side
```sh
$ cd python_program_server/
$ python main.py
```

### Client Side
##### After setting up the hardware, go to [python_program_client/] and execute the client program,
```sh
$ cd python_program_client/
$ python client.py
```

##### Visit localhost:9888/index

![Image 3](https://github.com/Embedded-Phelps/ECEN5053_002/blob/master/Projects/Project_2/pictures/main_page.png)

If it is your first time to visit the main page, you will be redirected to localhost:9888/login for asking the username and password. Once your are signed in with a the correct credential, the cookie will be stored and reused in next time when you visit.
